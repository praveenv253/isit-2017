- Introduce the problem (most of this can come from qual talk)
  - What is EEG?
    (and perhaps other brain measurement modalities:
        hint at the bigger picture; invite people to poster)
  - Source localization: forward and inverse problems, reconstructing the
    dipole
- Simplifying the brain model:
  real brain -> spherical -> one-dimensional model
  => reiterate what the key aspects in the problem were, and how they have
     been retained (low-pass filtering effect, circular nature of domain, etc.)
- Quickly talk about previous work:
  - CRLB (did not apply to biased estimators)
  - Info theory bound (did not give scaling in number of sensors)
- Our bound:
  - Give the bound expression and state implications
    => EEG resolution can improve with increase in # of sensors, and reduced
       noise
  - Explain the proof by diagrams: show two sources and explain when you are
    best able to distinguish them
    => Key thing here is to express the distance between the shifted kernels
       as a function of the extent of the shift i.e. Delta(s) in terms of delta
- Future work / Other bounding techniques:
  - Why not Ziv-Zakai?
  - Why not Fano?
  - Bound for the spherical head model
  - Going to real brains?
  - Possible ways to apply this more broadly (1D non-circular, nD)
- Summary
